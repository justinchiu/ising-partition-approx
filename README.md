# ising-partition-approx

Wasting time playing with Ising models instead of doing real work. :joy:

## Warmup
Fun little exercise for variational inference in a variant of an Ising model,
where the domain is binary.
Math written out [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hwvjhcttgpkc#f84304).


## Next
Will expand to more inference methods, a real Ising model, and maybe write a blog post?
